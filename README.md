## Difficulties and problems

- Limit switch placement â†’ We decided to optimize the placement of the switches closer to the circuit to reduce cable clutter.
- Wiring the servo motor for the pen mechanism â†’ We decided to leave the servo motor wires free to move, as we observed that they did not get stuck anywhere.
- Model and operation of the pen mechanism â†’ We solved the issue by creating a prototype, which helped us identify its problems. We fixed these by 3D printing a new mechanism that worked excellently. We also looked at online examples for inspiration.
- Motors and drivers â†’ Our team encountered many faulty or imprecise components, which caused headaches during the testing phase.
- ESP issues â†’ We opted to switch to Arduino, as it worked much better.
- GRBL library â†’ Hard limit issues caused by minor inaccuracies.
- Building the frame and structure â†’ After several prototypes and trials, we achieved a functional system.
- An unnecessary one-second delay was added to the servo motor, which significantly slowed the process.  â†’ Fixing this was easy ðŸ˜…
